# <PreWork Study Guide>

## Description
I developed a prework study guide using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the purpose of creating a tool for organizing ideas and concepts I will need to study in the future. I learned how to navigate between different branches, pull my code into GitHub, use VS code, and the differences and applications of HTML, CSS, and Java in web development.


## Installation

## Usage
The Prework study guide can be used to navigate between HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. If we open the DevTools console, we can see JavaScript running. It wil list the topics we learned and randomly choose one topic for us to study first.
